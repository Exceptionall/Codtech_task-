This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about various roller coasters. 
The goal is to gain insights into the data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Introduction

This notebook is part of a tutorial that can be found on the [Medallion Data Science YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxladMszXan-jfgzyeIMyvw). 
It walks through a step-by-step process of performing EDA using the roller coaster dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the roller coaster database, which contains information such as:
- Name of the roller coaster
- Location (country, park)
- Type (wooden, steel)
- Height, speed, and length
- Inversions and duration
- Other features related to design and performance

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/rollercoaster-database).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd exploratory-data-analysis-for-roller-coaster
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   The main dependencies include:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn

## Usage

To perform the analysis, run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook exploratory-data-analysis-for-roller-coaster.ipynb
```

Ensure that the dataset is available in the correct path or update the file path in the notebook to point to the dataset location.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data types, and necessary transformations.
2. **Data Visualization**: Plotting distribution of different features such as height, speed, length, etc.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing the relationships between variables (e.g., height vs. speed).
4. **Feature Insights**: Identifying trends related to coaster type, design, and location.
5. **Conclusions**: Summarizing the findings from the analysis.
